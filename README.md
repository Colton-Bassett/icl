# Colton Bassett 2020 Senior Project

Hey DJ,

Here's my senior project. I had a lot of fun working on it this semester! I wasn't able to get to deployment and a few other things like a I projected, but I did as much as I could. 

A couple of notes:
* In lieu of an app store link, I've recorded a demo of my project. You'll find the video under: video_demo.mp4
* The meat of the code is in the components directory
* I've left out my node_modules folder as it's ~500 mb.
* Mockups are in the mockup directory
* The Itemized Summary is ITEMIZED SUMMARY.pdf

I'm looking forward to working on this more in the future. Working remote this half of the semester has been an unexpected challenge (not just for me of course!). I would greatly appreciate if you held that in mind when reviewing my work. I hope you're doing well, thanks for an awesome semester!
